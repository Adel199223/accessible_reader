# Assistant Index

Use this folder as a lightweight routing layer. Do not treat it as the canonical source of product truth.

## Current Checkpoint
- Active checkpoint doc: `docs/exec_plans/active/2026-03-22_stage497_repo_closeout_and_cleanup_after_stage496.md`
- Resume shortcut: `resume for Stage 497 repo closeout`
- Current benchmark note: the March 22, 2026 Stage 496 Home audit remains the latest product checkpoint, and Stage 497 is the active branch-closeout plan that publishes the full Stage 369-496 backlog cleanly.
- Workflow reset: keep no new Recall-parity slice open during the closeout; create the two required commits, rerun the Stage 495/496 validation ladder, promote the branch to `main`, and prune stale branch refs before any new product milestone begins.
- Regression-only rule: `Notes` and `Study` stay parked as refreshed baselines, and `Reader` stays original-only and cosmetic-only unless the user explicitly unlocks generated-content work.

## Start Here
1. `BUILD_BRIEF.md`
2. `docs/ROADMAP.md`
3. `docs/ROADMAP_ANCHOR.md`
4. `docs/ux/recall_benchmark_matrix.md` when the task touches Recall shell or surface UI
5. the latest checkpoint ExecPlan(s) named in `docs/ROADMAP_ANCHOR.md`
6. this index

## Operating Defaults
- Run repo commands from WSL, preferably through `wsl.exe bash -lc ...` when working from Windows-side shells.
- Validate browser behavior in Windows Edge.
- Keep the app local-first.
- Treat browser-native speech as the shipped read-aloud path.
- Treat local TTS as `coming soon`.
- Keep AI opt-in and limited to `Simplify` and `Summary`.
- Use targeted validation before broad sweeps.
- Treat the benchmark matrix plus fresh screenshots as required when changing Recall shell or top-level surface UI.
- Treat wide-desktop before/after captures for the active section as required milestone artifacts, not optional polish.
- Audits verify regressions; they do not reopen the old queue or silently start another redesign slice unless the user explicitly changes priorities or a catastrophic regression forces a detour.
- In the current parity track, `Reader` is original-only and cosmetic-only. Do not touch `Reflowed`, `Simplified`, `Summary`, generated-view UX, transform logic, generated placeholders, generated-view controls, or mode-routing unless the user explicitly reprioritizes that work.
- Stale temp files, superseded screenshot harness files, dead CSS hooks, and other non-essential generated scaffolding may be deleted when they stop helping; do not let preserving obsolete files slow roadmap work down.
- Prefer targeted component tests first, then use the broad `frontend/src/App.test.tsx` pass when shell or route continuity changes, and keep the repo-owned Edge screenshot harness as the visual truth source for Recall surface work.
- If the broad `App.test.tsx` file ever appears to stall again, check for App-level callback identity churn and `ReaderWorkspace` effect loops before downgrading the whole-file suite; that was the root cause of the last real stall.
- Keep push explicit.

## Use When
- Read `docs/assistant/APP_KNOWLEDGE.md` when you need a short project snapshot before opening source files.
- Read `docs/assistant/workflows/ROADMAP_WORKFLOW.md` when the user says `roadmap`, `master plan`, or `next milestone`.
- Read `docs/ux/recall_benchmark_matrix.md` when the task touches Recall shell, Library/home, Add Content, Graph, Study, or other benchmark-sensitive UI work.
- Read `docs/assistant/workflows/EDGE_SPEECH_VALIDATION_WORKFLOW.md` when the task touches Edge speech, highlighting, progress restore, or manual browser validation.
- Read `docs/assistant/templates/CODEX_DELTA_REFINEMENT_PROMPT.md` only when the user explicitly asks for a follow-up delta/refinement prompt that folds later prototype learnings back into the shipped app.
- Read `agent.md` for the short repo runbook.
- If `docs/exec_plans/active/` contains both the current implementation plan and a pre-staged next audit plan, use this index plus `docs/ROADMAP_ANCHOR.md` to identify the current one instead of following the highest stage number blindly.

## Do Not Use
- Do not use this folder to override `BUILD_BRIEF.md`, roadmap docs, or source code.
- Do not open `docs/assistant/templates/*` unless the user explicitly asks for harness/bootstrap prompt work or a delta/refinement prompt.
