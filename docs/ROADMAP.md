# Roadmap

## Product Direction

Keep this repository as one local-first workspace.

- The existing accessible-reader app remains the reader/converter sibling app.
- `backend/` remains the single local service host for reader, converter, and future Recall surfaces.
- Shared storage and domain contracts must support current reader behavior first, then expand toward Recall graph/study/export features without a rewrite.

## Status As Of 2026-03-13

- The accessible-reader app already provides local import for TXT, Markdown, HTML, DOCX, and text-based PDF, deterministic `Original` and `Reflowed` views, opt-in AI `Simplify` and `Summary`, local library/search, saved progress/settings, and Edge-first browser speech.
- A bounded Stage 1A detour is now implemented on the reader branch: public article-style webpage import fetches once on the backend, stores a local HTML snapshot, extracts readable article content locally, and reuses the normal reader pipeline. It remains snapshot-only; live URL sync and "import current tab" behavior are still out of scope.
- Stage 1B shared-core groundwork is now implemented in the backend:
  - `workspace.db` is the primary database target
  - legacy `reader.db` migrates automatically when present
  - shared tables now exist for source documents, document variants, reading sessions, app settings, change events, and future Recall-oriented entities
  - current reader API responses remain stable through the repository layer
  - shared storage now includes a generic source locator so future URL import can fit without another schema redesign
- Stage 1 closeout is complete:
  - the interrupted validation rerun was resumed and verified green on 2026-03-13
  - frontend `npm test -- --run`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` pass
  - backend `pytest` and app import checks pass
- Stage 2 closeout is complete:
  - `Recall` is now the default product shell
  - the current accessible-reader experience stays as an integrated Reader section inside that shell
  - deterministic chunking, keyword retrieval, and Markdown export now run over the shared document core
- The user-directed combined Stage 3 and Stage 4 pass is now complete:
  - deterministic graph extraction, confidence-ranked graph suggestions, and manual confirm/reject loops are live
  - hybrid retrieval now blends chunk, graph, and study-card evidence
  - source-grounded study cards and FSRS-backed review logs are live in Recall
  - the slice remains local-first and deterministic by default
  - AI scope is still unchanged and opt-in only for `Simplify` and `Summary`
- Stage 5 closeout is complete:
  - a bounded MV3 browser companion now runs against the existing localhost backend
  - low-noise contextual resurfacing is live through an in-page chip, popup, and options page
  - the extension stays context-only; current-tab import and live capture remain out of scope
  - backend browser-context retrieval, extension tests/build, and an Edge unpacked-extension smoke run are green
- Stage 6 closeout is complete:
  - Markdown round-trip fidelity now preserves ordered lists, nested lists, quotes, and heading levels through import, reflow, and export
  - shared document views now carry block metadata and deterministic variant metadata across local and AI-backed variants
  - shared reading sessions now persist summary detail and accessibility snapshots alongside sentence progress
  - Reader now falls back to backend last-session state when browser-local session storage is absent
  - backend/frontend validation and an Edge structured-Markdown/session-restore smoke run are green
- Stage 7 closeout is complete:
  - incremental workspace change-log APIs are now live over the shared change-event stream
  - portable attachment refs and workspace export manifests are now live
  - workspace export zip bundles now include `manifest.json` plus stored source attachments
  - deterministic merge-preview rules are now live without enabling full sync or background replay
  - backend/frontend validation and a localhost manifest/export/merge smoke run are green
- Stage 8 closeout is complete:
  - workspace integrity and repair APIs are now live
  - startup self-healing now repairs drifted FTS indexes and refreshes derived Recall state when versions or indexes are stale
  - workspace export manifests now surface non-fatal missing-attachment warnings while zip export remains available
  - a deterministic benchmark harness now measures ingest, retrieval, browser-context, export, merge preview, and study scheduling flows
  - backend/frontend/extension validation, benchmark runs, and a localhost integrity/repair smoke run are green
- A bounded pre-Stage-9 stabilization detour is now complete:
  - fetch-level network failures now show actionable local-service reconnect guidance instead of raw `Failed to fetch`
  - Recall now reports explicit unavailable states for library, graph, study, and document-detail loading, each with retry actions
  - Reader now distinguishes an empty library from a temporary local-service outage while keeping import controls usable
  - backend/frontend/extension validation plus live Playwright outage-and-recovery smoke coverage are green
- A post-Stage-8 roadmap extension is now approved:
  - Stage 9 will add source-linked highlights and notes inside Reader and Recall
  - Stage 10 will extend note capture through the browser companion and fold notes into retrieval
  - Stage 11 will carry notes through portable apply flows and support manual promotion into graph/study workflows

## Active Milestone

1. Stage 9: Source-Linked Highlights and Notes
   - Reader capture for sentence-range highlights with optional note text
   - Recall notes section, note search, and Reader jump-back
   - shared note storage, note FTS, and note change-log coverage

## Next Milestone

1. Stage 10: Browser Note Capture and Note-Aware Retrieval
   - manual note capture from exact saved public-page matches in the MV3 companion
   - note hits added to Recall retrieval and browser-context summaries

## Stage Map

1. Stage 1: Baseline Stabilization and Shared Core Extraction

2. Stage 2: Recall Foundation Vertical Slice
   - Recall-first shell and Reader integration
   - deterministic chunking over shared documents
   - keyword retrieval and first Markdown export path
3. Stage 3: Knowledge Graph V1

   - Reader jump-back from note anchors
10. Stage 10: Browser Note Capture and Note-Aware Retrieval
   - manual note capture from the MV3 companion for exact saved public-page matches
   - note-aware retrieval and browser-context surfacing
11. Stage 11: Portable Annotation Apply and Manual Knowledge Promotion
   - note entities in export/merge/apply flows
   - manual promotion from notes into graph evidence or study-card seeds

## Deferred Follow-Ups

- keep local TTS deferred as `coming soon`
- keep OCR for scanned or image-only PDFs deferred
- keep AI opt-in and limited to `Simplify` and `Summary`
- keep cloud sync, collaboration, and chat/Q&A out of scope unless explicitly reprioritized

## Working Rules

- `roadmap`, `master plan`, and `next milestone` mean this file unless explicitly redirected
- log detours in `docs/ROADMAP_ANCHOR.md`
- prefer shared-core and Recall-shell work over reopening broad reader UI churn
- return to the roadmap after blockers or corrections are resolved
