# Roadmap

## Product Direction

Keep this repository as one local-first workspace.

- The existing accessible-reader app remains the reader/converter sibling app.
- `backend/` remains the single local service host for reader, converter, and future Recall surfaces.
- Shared storage and domain contracts must support current reader behavior first, then expand toward Recall graph/study/export features without a rewrite.

## Status As Of 2026-03-13

- The accessible-reader app already provides local import for TXT, Markdown, HTML, DOCX, and text-based PDF, deterministic `Original` and `Reflowed` views, opt-in AI `Simplify` and `Summary`, local library/search, saved progress/settings, and Edge-first browser speech.
- A bounded Stage 1A detour is now implemented on the reader branch: public article-style webpage import fetches once on the backend, stores a local HTML snapshot, extracts readable article content locally, and reuses the normal reader pipeline. It remains snapshot-only; live URL sync and "import current tab" behavior are still out of scope.
- Stage 1B shared-core groundwork is now implemented in the backend:
  - `workspace.db` is the primary database target
  - legacy `reader.db` migrates automatically when present
  - shared tables now exist for source documents, document variants, reading sessions, app settings, change events, and future Recall-oriented entities
  - current reader API responses remain stable through the repository layer
  - shared storage now includes a generic source locator so future URL import can fit without another schema redesign
- Stage 1A frontend reconciliation is still active because the accessible-reader UI cleanup and webpage-import work are landing in parallel with shared-core changes and must stay validation-green together.

## Active Milestone

1. Stage 1: Baseline Stabilization and Shared Core Extraction
   - keep backend shared-core work green and compatible with current reader behavior
   - keep the active reader/UI branch and the new webpage snapshot import green while shared-core work settles
   - preserve browser-native speech, opt-in AI, and current reader route shapes
   - keep webpage import article-first, snapshot-based, and local-first after fetch
   - keep shared storage ready for reader, converter, Recall, and later tablet-safe change tracking

## Next Milestone

1. Stage 2: Recall Foundation Vertical Slice
   - expose a Recall-oriented library view backed by shared source documents
   - add chunking and keyword retrieval over shared content
   - add Markdown export with provenance for a single shared document

## Stage Map

1. Stage 1: Baseline Stabilization and Shared Core Extraction
   - 1A: rerun and reconcile frontend lint/test/build after the active reader UI/web-link pass lands
   - 1B: shared document-core schema, migration path, change log, and compatibility tests
2. Stage 2: Recall Foundation Vertical Slice
   - import into shared storage
   - chunk documents
   - ship keyword search and first Markdown export path
3. Stage 3: Knowledge Graph V1
   - provenance-aware entity and relation groundwork
   - confidence-ranked linking
   - manual correction loop
4. Stage 4: Retrieval and Study Engine
   - hybrid search
   - source-grounded card generation
   - FSRS-backed scheduling and review logs
5. Stage 5: Augmented Browsing
   - MV3 extension
   - localhost retrieval
   - low-noise contextual resurfacing
6. Stage 6: Portability and Accessibility Integration
   - Markdown round-trip quality
   - shared reader/converter document-variant contracts
   - common reading-session and accessibility metadata
7. Stage 7: Tablet-Safe Groundwork
   - change-log APIs
   - portable attachments
   - deterministic merge rules without full sync yet
8. Stage 8: Hardening and Benchmarks
   - ingest, retrieval, extension, export, and scheduling benchmarks
   - migration hardening and recovery paths

## Deferred Follow-Ups

- keep local TTS deferred as `coming soon`
- keep OCR for scanned or image-only PDFs deferred
- keep AI opt-in and limited to `Simplify` and `Summary`
- keep cloud sync, collaboration, and chat/Q&A out of scope unless explicitly reprioritized

## Working Rules

- `roadmap`, `master plan`, and `next milestone` mean this file unless explicitly redirected
- log detours in `docs/ROADMAP_ANCHOR.md`
- prefer backend/shared-core work over frontend churn while the reader UI branch is actively changing elsewhere
- return to the roadmap after blockers or corrections are resolved

## Recent Detours

- 2026-03-13: added Stage 0/1 planning artifacts, decision/risk/assumption/backlog logs, repo-fit notes, and future integration logs
- 2026-03-13: completed the first shared-core backend slice with `workspace.db`, legacy `reader.db` migration, shared tables, UUIDv7-style IDs for new shared records, and migration coverage in backend tests
- 2026-03-13: implemented and validated bounded public webpage snapshot import for article-style pages, including backend fetch/extraction, local HTML snapshot storage, frontend `Web page` disclosure, and delete-path cleanup for saved snapshots
